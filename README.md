## Description

A code along challenge from [Dr. Joshua Bastean's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xHErfmj1F4&list=PLQSmIhc0GVPPhpBAC3y6xChtOz3RJ8abN&index=137) Full Stack Web Developer Course on Youtube. I started this challenge because I intended to create a project for a friend of mine, which requries knowledge of backend technologies. I already have some frontend knowledge and I think this project had just solidified everything for me. It also introduced me to bootstrap and ejs which I think were pretty cool.

The website features a list of all users' anime lists and can be filtered based on genre. Each anime is associated with 1 user who is the author. It has a show page for that particular anime which displays different information as well as upvotes and reviews. The author can edit or delete that anime whenever they choose. The website also provides an option for users to log in or sign if they want, and if they choose to do so, it gives them the freedom to add new anime, add comment on other user's anime or upvote or downvote that anime.

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap
- EJS
- Nodejs
- Express
- Mongodb
- Mongoose
- Passport.js for authentication
## Expected Features
- Home Page
- All anime page
- Show page for selected anime
- Navigation bar with the following:
	- an icon to go to the home screen
	- all animes page
	- genres to filter
 - option to log in or sign up
- Log In or Sign Up Page
- Ability to add a comment or upvote if authenticated

## Additional Features in the Future
- The original tutorial has the option to use indexing to be able to create a search from the database, however, the technology has since been deprecated during the time that I was making the project. I still have to learn more about indexing or find a different alternative so I have skipped it for now.
- Responsiveness - I feel guilty about this but I'll find time to fix it one day.
- Better UI - I think it looks sloppy
- tests

## Things I Learned While Building This Project
Where do I even begin? I really enjoyed making this project and learned so much while I'm at it. Here are a few that I can remember right now:
- Basic understanding of Express, Mongodb, Mongoose and Bootstrap
- RESTful applications
- Using schema to determine the structure of data
- Routing
- The tutorial also gave a very basic explanation of authentication and authorization.
